# ECE449 Review

## Classical ML

- Regression and classfication
- supervised vs unsupervised 
- model optim types
- tradeoff between bias & variance
- over & under fitting, setting hyperparameter
- Validation set: why & how(held-out/cros)

- Linear regression and fitting, define MSE Loss
- derivertive ?
- extenion to non-linear (fit polynomial)
- matrix form, closed form solution
- regularization, pick \lambda
- LASSO (no closed form)

# Unsupervised Learning

- KNN instance based learning
- SVM
- objective function 
- Non-linear features
- extension to multi-class



- perception and newton method
  - Limitiation 
  - linear classfication and outline linearning
  - Newton as "weighted sum" -> multilayer
  - activation function 
  - chain rule in optimization
- neural netwons
- simple backup and computational graph 
- convolution keywords
  - \#parameter
- Drepout
- CR scheduler
- contribution of such generation of Image Net
- **Receptive field**
  - |X| COW
  - Depthwise
  - grouped
- RNN & variation 
- $h_t = f(h_{t-1},x_t)$
- captioning, projection 

## Modern Machine Learning

- LSTM & understand its get, benefit comptutation graph
- Attention & Transformer 
  - KQV
  - Multi-head
  - positional encoding
  - space attention, why
- Graph NN
  - Tab
  - Learning node embeddings
  - $h = \sigma(W*\sum h/N + Bh)$ weighted previous ?
  - GCN
  - 不考SAGE

## NLP

- N-grams

- **Markov assumption**

- smoothing

- > problems 

- Disadvantage of one-hot



- Word2Vec
- GPT & BERT
- Naive Bayes classfication
- bayesian rule
- MAP
